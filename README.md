# What is this ?
I love making classes in Godot, but I did not like the fact new classes were the default circle.
So as a cost effective measure I decided to make this to generate .svg similar to default Github profile pic.

# Have a look !

This is very simple but I love being able to tell apart my file from just a quick glance at the icon rather than the name.

# How to use
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d48922-162c-489e-8bf2-0854add5ea60)
1. Open the scene
2. Select the root node
3. Tweak the settings the press create, it should be created in the "output" folder 
Note: Godot has trouble noticing a new file has been created â†’ moving your mouse outside the window then back inside will make Godot realise what happens

# Want to improve it ? Please do !
This addon while great still requires you to move the newly made icon to its residency place, if you know how to detect a new class has been created and automatically make it this "icon" please open a pull request.
